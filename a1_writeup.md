# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

It''s fairly similar to java.script, but its way easier. I think it took me while to actully understand the languages because if I zoned out for one part of the lecture, I would get confused on what a sign would mean because its such a condensed language. I am very excited to learn how to do more on this language.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

The loops in the program are very similar to java, even using the same controller symbol. The use of 'while' and 'if' and 'else' are all java terms that i have learnd already. The differences in between the languages, as previously stated, is the way that python is more condensed than java. Also the semicolons, that a big thing about java that isn't here in python. If there wasnt semicolons at the end of lines the code would have a lot of bugs.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

I obviously learned the basics of python. But I also learned how to apply them to make certin tasks. I also learned how to use AI in order to learn more about python code. For example, the bugs that could be in your code can be detected by AI and then they can explain why your code didn't work and how you should improve it.
